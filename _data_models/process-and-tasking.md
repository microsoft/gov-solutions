## Process and Tasking: A Data Model for Government Workflow Automation

The Process and Tasking module is designed to bring structure, visibility, and automation to complex government workflows. Many federal programs depend on repeatable processes—whether they involve onboarding staff, approving grants, reviewing compliance submissions, or managing public requests. While these processes often differ in content, they share a common pattern: a series of steps that need to be followed, tracked, and completed against specific cases, requests, or records. This module provides a standardized way to model those processes and the tasks they generate, enabling agencies to automate workflows and monitor progress across programs.

At the core of the module is the distinction between process design and process execution. Process design is captured through **Process Step** records, which define the building blocks of a workflow. These steps are grouped into process templates and can include dependencies, tools, and instructions. When a process is launched for a specific case or record—known as the primary record—those steps are instantiated as **Action Items**. **Action Items** represent the live, trackable work that needs to be completed, including due dates, status, assigned staff, and linked documents. As agencies transition to this model, the older **Action Assignment** table is being phased out in favor of the richer **Action Item** structure.

The module also includes a range of supporting tables that help make these workflows more effective and interactive. **Action Category** allows agencies to classify tasks by type or priority, improving reporting and workload balancing. **Collaboration Space** and **Discussion Item** bring people together to coordinate work, share updates, and resolve issues directly in context. For processes that require structured inputs, the module offers **Data Form**, **Data Entry Step**, and **Data Entry Response**, enabling step-specific form completion and data capture.

Interactivity is another strength of the model. **Interactive Prompt**, along with its related **Choice** and **Choice Option** tables, supports guided decision-making inside a process. These prompts can present users with branching questions or multiple-choice selections, influencing the flow of tasks that follow. **Signature Approval** integrates formal sign-off into the workflow, while **Document** and **Content Template** support document generation, review, and storage as part of the process itself.

In practice, this module is designed to work alongside other domain-specific solutions. A compliance monitoring system might define a process template for conducting an audit, with **Process Steps** for scheduling site visits, collecting evidence, reviewing findings, and issuing recommendations. Those steps would become **Action Items** tied to the specific audit record, with due dates and assignments to auditors. A public records request app could model the review and release workflow, using **Interactive Prompts** to determine whether exemptions apply, and **Signature Approval** to finalize responses. Even grant-making programs could use it to automate post-award monitoring, assigning **Action Items** for quarterly reporting, budget reviews, and site inspections.

By separating the blueprint of a process from its execution, and by giving agencies a flexible, reusable data structure for tracking work, the Process and Tasking module makes process automation not just possible but practical. It is a natural complement to other government data models, delivering the glue that connects domain-specific data to the actions and people that move work forward.
