## Court Case Management: A Data Model for Judicial Proceedings

The **Court Case Management** module provides a structured framework for agencies and judicial bodies that need to manage the flow of legal cases, from filing through resolution. Courts and administrative tribunals alike must keep track of parties, filings, motions, hearings, and orders in a way that is both organized and transparent. This module brings those pieces together into a single, reusable data model, giving agencies the tools to manage cases efficiently while preserving a complete historical record.

At the heart of the model is the **Court Case** table, which represents the proceeding itself. Each case can be linked to **Court Case Parties**, identifying plaintiffs, defendants, counsel, or other participants, along with their roles in the matter. This ensures that all stakeholders are properly documented and that relationships between them are clear throughout the lifecycle of the case.

Supporting records provide the detail that makes case management complete. **Court Documents** represent the filings, exhibits, or other written materials tied to a case, creating a centralized record of the written history. **Court Motions** capture specific requests made to the court, such as motions to dismiss or to compel, while **Court Orders** document the rulings and directives that result. Together, these records show the back-and-forth of the judicial process, linking the arguments made to the decisions rendered.

Proceedings are organized through **Court Hearings** and **Court Sessions**. Hearings represent scheduled appearances for arguments, testimony, or procedural matters, while Sessions provide the formal structure of the court’s calendar, often encompassing multiple cases or hearings in a given time slot. Linking cases to sessions and hearings allows agencies to track not only what happened in a matter but also when and in what forum.

In practice, this module can support a variety of judicial and quasi-judicial contexts. A federal administrative court might use it to track enforcement cases, linking documents, motions, and orders into a complete case record. A tribunal handling benefits appeals could use Party records to manage claimants and representatives, while hearings and sessions organize the docket. Even internal agency adjudications—such as disciplinary boards—can benefit from the same structured approach.

By combining cases, parties, documents, and proceedings into a unified model, the Court Case Management module provides a clear and auditable record of judicial actions. It enables better scheduling, easier retrieval of documents and rulings, and more consistent reporting on case status and outcomes. Most importantly, it ensures that the judicial process is captured not just as a collection of documents, but as a structured set of relationships and events that can be understood, tracked, and acted upon.
