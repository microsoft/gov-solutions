# Formatting Release Notes

When asked to format a release notes, format the actual release notes content like the following example. Components are the tables, views, forms, etc. that changed. Use _data_model_releases/core/v1.0.2.2.md as an example. Leave the date if provided or insert today's date.

Also set the front matter metadata as much as possible. Include a short description summarizing the changes.

    - Description of change (added, changed, removed, etc.)

-   **Component 2 Name**
    - Description of change (added, changed, removed, etc.)
