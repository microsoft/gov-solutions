This is an initial baseline release of the Training and Certification data model, to help you in scenarios where you need to track training courses, classes, enrollments, attendees, and related information. In a baseline release you will find many of the core entities, fields, and relationships needed to build an application, but you may also need to spend some time adding additional data elements required for your needs. We are always looking for feedback! Please send ideas and suggestions for improvement.

-   **Included components**
    - Training Achievements, Training Certificates, Training Classes, Training Class Attendees, Training Class Enrollees, Training Courses, Training Course Enrollees, Training Instructors, and Training Objectives.
