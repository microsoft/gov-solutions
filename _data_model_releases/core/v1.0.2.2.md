        - Approved — manager/supervisor/finance has accepted the commitment
        - Final / Complete — period closed or action executed; no further changes expected

-   **Personnel Availability**
    - New choice field with values: Onsite, Remote, Leave, Travel, Training, Unavailable, Overtime Window, Reserve
    - These options support clearer schedule tracking and availability reporting.
