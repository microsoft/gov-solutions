## Overview

Government case management systems coordinate services, decisions, and records around a person, business, matter, or incident. They provide a single authoritative case record that captures intake, activities, tasks, documents, decisions, and outcomes while enforcing policy, auditability, and data protection required for public-sector programs.

This page summarizes common government case management patterns, recommended features, data elements, and implementation considerations to help teams design and procure systems that improve outcomes, transparency, and operational efficiency.

## Where case management is used

- Social services and benefits (eligibility, enrollment, compliance)
- Licensing and permitting (permits, inspections, renewals)
- Public safety and incident response (investigations, incident tracking)
- Regulatory enforcement and audits
- Constituent services and complaint resolution
- Workforce and personnel actions

## Goals and outcomes

- Deliver timely, consistent, and auditable decisions
- Reduce average case processing time and backlog
- Improve coordination across teams and partner organizations
- Protect privacy and meet legal/compliance requirements
- Make data available for program performance and policy decisions

## Common workflows

1. Intake & triage
   - Capture case metadata, contact information, attachments, and preferred communication channel.
   - Triage by priority, jurisdiction, or risk scoring; create tasks and assign owners.

2. Investigation & collection
   - Track events, interviews, evidence, and chain-of-custody for documents.
   - Record findings, intermediate decisions, and notifications.

3. Assessment & determination
   - Apply rules, checklists, or decision trees to determine eligibility, compliance, or next steps.
   - Support manual overrides with supervisor approvals and reasoning.

4. Service delivery & referrals
   - Generate work orders, vouchers, referrals to external partners, or schedule inspections.
   - Monitor service completion and outcomes.

5. Appeals, reviews & closure
   - Record appeals, hearings, reconsiderations, and final outcomes.
   - Close the case with an audit trail and retention metadata.

6. Audit & reporting
   - Provide immutable logs for who changed what and when.
   - Generate operational dashboards and program reports.

## Core data model (typical entities)

- Case (case id, status, type, jurisdiction, priority, opened/closed dates)
- Parties (applicant, respondent, service providers, third parties)
- Contacts and addresses
- Events / Activities (notes, interviews, site visits)
- Tasks and assignments
- Documents and attachments (with classification/PII tags)
- Decisions and outcomes (reason codes, timestamps)
- Audit log and change history
- Payments, fees, or benefits (when applicable)

Data classification and PII tags should be part of the model to support access controls and redaction needs.

## Roles & access control

- Intake officer: create cases, capture initial data
- Caseworker: manage case activities, documents, and decisions
- Supervisor: review, approve, or reassign cases
- Auditor/compliance: read-only access to full history
- External partner: scoped access to specific documents or tasks
- Admin: configuration, user/role management

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based rules that can enforce field-level restrictions and separation of duties.

## Key features to evaluate

- Configurable workflows and business rules engine
- Document management with versioning and secure attachments
- Audit trail, retention, and legal hold support
- Fine-grained RBAC and delegated access for partners
- Case-level and system-wide search
- Notifications, alerts, and scheduled tasks
- Mobile-friendly UI and offline capabilities for field workers
- Open, documented APIs and event streams for integrations
- Reporting, dashboards, and analytics
- Multi-jurisdiction and multi-program configuration

## Integrations

Successful case management depends on integrations with:

- Identity providers and SSO (SAML, OpenID Connect)
- Document storage and DLP systems
- Payment processors and finance systems
- GIS/mapping for inspections and incidents
- Health or benefit systems (for social services)
- CRM or constituent management systems
- Data warehouses and analytics platforms

## Security, privacy & compliance

- Encrypt data at rest and in transit; apply key management best practices.
- Limit access to PII via least-privilege and field-level controls.
- Maintain immutable audit logs for legal and FOIA requests.
- Implement data retention and disposal policies based on records schedules.
- Perform privacy impact and security assessments early in the project.

## Accessibility & user experience

- Build to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for public-facing forms.
- Provide clear, plain-language guidance during intake.
- Offer multilingual support and alternate communication channels.
- Optimize forms and workflows for high-volume processing and reduced cognitive load.

## Success metrics

- Average days to resolution
- Percentage of cases closed within SLA
- First-contact resolution rate
- Backlog volume and age distribution
- Outcome quality and beneficiary satisfaction
- Audit exceptions and compliance incidents

## Example scenarios

- Social benefits: automate eligibility checks, schedule interviews, track benefit disbursements and appeals.
- Licensing & permitting: intake digital applications, route for inspection, record inspection results, and publish permit decisions.
- Incident response: create incident cases, assign field teams, collect evidence, and track remediation tasks.
