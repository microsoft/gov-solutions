## Overview

Personnel Security covers the policies, processes, and technical controls that ensure the right people are granted the right access for the right reasonsâ€”and that access is continuously validated and removed when no longer required. In government contexts this includes background investigations and clearances, role-based access provisioning, continuous monitoring of privileged activity, and robust offboarding to protect sensitive information, mission continuity, and public trust.

- Mission scenarios: onboarding staff and contractors with sensitive access; provisioning privileged accounts for mission-critical systems; responding to suspected insider threats or clearance changes.  
- Importance: reduces insider risk, enables least-privilege enforcement, supports regulatory compliance (e.g., NIST/FISMA guidance), and preserves operational integrity.

## Where Personnel Security is used

Common agency contexts and domains:

- Defense, intelligence, and national security organizations.  
- Law enforcement and public safety agencies.  
- Civilian agencies handling sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), health, or financial data.  
- Agencies that manage contractor workforces or grant-funded programs.  
- IT and operations teams responsible for privileged accounts and critical infrastructure.

## High level processes

Outline of major processes and interacting personas:

- Workforce planning and role definition  
  - Actors: HR Administrator, Hiring Manager, Mission Owner  
  - Define required roles, sensitivity levels, and clearance requirements.

- Pre-employment screening and adjudication  
  - Actors: Security/Personnel Office, Background Investigation Provider  
  - Conduct checks, adjudicate findings, and record eligibility for required roles.

- Onboarding and access provisioning  
  - Actors: Identity/Access Administrator, IT Operations, New Employee/Contractor  
  - Create accounts, assign roles and permissions based on least privilege, deliver required training and policy acknowledgments.

- Authorization and continuous validation  
  - Actors: Security Officer, System Owners, Identity Management  
  - Periodic revalidation of access, certification campaigns, continuous monitoring of anomalous behavior and privileged actions.

- Role changes and transfers  
  - Actors: HR, Identity Admin, Manager  
  - Update access as job duties change; enforce change reviews.

- Offboarding and deprovisioning  
  - Actors: HR, Identity Admin, Facilities  
  - Revoke accounts and credentials, recover assets, ensure timely removal of access and privileges.

- Incident response and adjudication  
  - Actors: Insider Threat Program, Security Operations, Legal/Compliance  
  - Investigate suspicious activity, take corrective action, and update policies or access controls.

## Common needs and challenges

Typical requirements and pain points for agencies:

- Reliable integration between HR systems (HRIS) and identity/access management to support rapid, auditable provisioning and deprovisioning.  
- Automation to enforce least privilege and reduce manual errors for high-volume onboarding and contractor lifecycles.  
- Scalability and timeliness of background investigations and clearance processes.  
- Clear ownership, workflows, and SLAs for access changes and revocations.  
- Continuous monitoring and analytics tailored to detect insider risk and privileged misuse.  
- Maintaining audit trails, evidence for audits, and demonstrable compliance with government standards.  
- Balancing privacy and data minimization with investigative and security needs.

## Success measures

Measurable outcomes and KPIs agencies use to evaluate personnel security:

- Mean time to provision compliant access for new hires and contractors.  
- Mean time to deprovision after termination or role change.  
- Percentage of privileged accounts with documented business justification and least-privilege configuration.  
- Rate of completed access recertifications on schedule.  
- Reduction in incidents attributable to insider misuse or improper access.  
- Number and severity of audit findings related to personnel security processes.
