ðŸ†• Team Ownership

Items can now be owned by teams, allowing any team member to edit and add related items. This is especially useful for teams that produce solutions and IP togetherâ€”now you can collaborate more easily and ensure your contributions are well represented in the catalog.

ðŸ†• Show Related Options

Items can be related to one another. As the owner of an item, you can now configure what appears in the "Related Items" tab.

*   Show Direct Children and Linked To: Displays only the items youâ€™ve explicitly addedâ€”giving you tighter control.
*   Show Direct Children, Linked To, and Linked From: Includes the items youâ€™ve added plus any items that reference yours. This option helps surface related solutions and promote othersâ€™ IP.

Regardless of your selection, any items that reference your item will always appear in the "Found In" tab. This option can be found in the "Preview" tab of the item editor.

ðŸ†• Nexus Experience

Based on feedback, a new "Nexus" experience is available for users as an option. This new experience streamlines the user interface experience and puts the focus on the general type of item, with optional category filter.
