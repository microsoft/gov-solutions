    - Added Action Items and replaced the Executive Action Main form with an Information form (removed the baseline Main form).
    - Added Source Legal Authority, Source Analysis, Source Impact, and Source Risk item fields to the Executive Action form.

- **Forms & Sitemap**
    - Added module-specific Legal Authority, Analysis, Impact, and Risk Item information forms and integrated the Executive Actions grid into those forms.
    - Removed baseline forms from the model-driven app sitemap.

- **Process and Tasking integration**
    - Integrated the Process and Tasking Action Item with the Executive Action form to enable templated business processes.

- **Legal Authority Analyzer (Custom page)**
    - Added a Legal Authority Analyzer custom page that uses an AI model component to help summarize legal authorities and identify department-specific risks and impacts.

- **Deprecated**
    - Removed Action Assignments from the model-driven app (deprecated; replaced by Action Items).
