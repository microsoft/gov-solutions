### Baseline and Master Calendar

This first release includes baseline functionality for a model-driven app showing Events and Activities. One possible use here is to use the Events table for formal and public-facing Events use the OOB Activities for internal meetings, tasks, phone calls, etc. The grid views have been configured to use the calendar control.

This release also includes a Canvas App and Power BI Report to show multiple ways of combining events from multiple sources into a single visual representation. In this sample, Dataverse Events records are combined with events from a SharePoint list. The Canvas App uses PowerFX formulas and a Calendar component control. The Power BI report uses DAX expressions and a calendar visual. Both can be modified as needed.
