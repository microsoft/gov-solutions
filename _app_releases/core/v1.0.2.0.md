## Release 1.0.2.0 (Jun-06, 2025)

- **Version Synchronization with Process and Tasking Solution:**
    - This release aligns the Core data model version with the Process and Tasking data model (v1.0.2.0), ensuring compatibility and seamless integration between modules. Version synchronization helps maintain consistent data structures, relationships, and reference entities across both solutions, reducing integration effort and supporting unified enterprise workflows.


This update is primarily administrative, focused on version alignment to support coordinated deployments and interoperability. No new features or schema changes are introduced in this release. Implementors can confidently deploy or upgrade both solutions together, knowing that data model dependencies are managed and cross-solution scenarios are supported.
