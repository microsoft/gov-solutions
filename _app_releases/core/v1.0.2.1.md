## Release 1.0.2.1 (Sep-15, 2025)

- **Core JavaScript (msfed_core.js):** Added openSidePane and related functions to enable opening a custom page as a side pane. Add a Custom Page State (`msfed_custompagestate`) field to your form to use it. This hidden field will track communications from your custom page.
- **Documents:** Configured Quick Create form.
- **Core - Name Utility:** New JavaScript library to assist with supplying values for the name field, based on other fields on the form.
  - `replacePrefixFromLookup` — Automatically sets a field value (e.g., Name) using a new prefix and the suffix from a related lookup’s name. Example: Converts `INV-12345` to `ADJ-12345` using a mapped lookup.

  - `generateFieldFromPattern` — Populates a field dynamically using a pattern string with placeholders (e.g., `${contactid.name}`) that reference other fields on the form. Supports text, lookups, option sets (labels), and dates.

  - `setupPatternWatcher` — Centralizes dynamic name generation by automatically re-generating the field value when any dependent field changes. Eliminates the need to manually bind multiple `onChange` handlers.
- **Personal Information:** Added new table to sitemap, configured baseline forms and views.
- **Personal Information Types:** Added new table to sitemap, configured baseline forms and views.

This release adds client-side utilities and UI enhancements to support custom pages (side panes), automated name generation patterns, and baseline Personal Information entities to the model-driven app. Implementors should add the `msfed_custompagestate` hidden field to forms that host custom pages and may opt into the Name Utility library to centralize dynamic field generation.
