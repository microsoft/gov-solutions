This release provides the initial model-driven app for the Time, Travel, and Expenses solution. It establishes the app shell and sitemap and configures baseline forms and views for Availability. Forms and views for the remaining tables will be configured in a future release.

- **App shell & sitemap**
  - Added sections for Time, Travel, and Expenses.
  - Starter tables included in the app shell: Expense Item Category, Expense Report, Expense Report Line Item, Time Entry, Time Period, Time Project, Time Project Task.

- **Availability**
  - Added the Time Availability table (renamed to Availability) from the data model and configured baseline model-driven app forms and views for it.

Note: This release focuses on providing the Availability baseline within the model-driven app. Additional form and view customizations for Time Entry, Travel, and Expense tables will be implemented in subsequent releases.
