- **Data Forms Canvas App (proof of concept):** Demonstrates a data-form centric hierarchy of tasks and a new approach to form-driven workflows.

- **Custom page for related Action Assignments:** Added a custom page to show related Action Assignments for a parent record. This uses the "Get Action Assignments for Record" flow to retrieve assignments for the record and provides an initial proof-of-concept foundation for future enhancements.

- **Action Assignments dashboard:** Introduced a dashboard for monitoring and managing action assignments across the system.

This release focuses on early experiments and UI proof-of-concept components to enable richer form-driven task experiences and better visualization of action assignments.
