* Namespace and naming update:
  - All schema namespaces have been converted from `msfed_` to `msgov_` to improve compatibility with State, Local, and other government entities outside the federal sector.
  - Human-readable naming strings changed from "Federal" to "Government" where applicable.

* What remains unchanged:
  - Underlying data model releases continue to use the `govcdm_` prefix and were not altered by this release.

* Impact and guidance:
  - This is a schema/naming update only. Existing data model content remains compatible; agencies and implementers should update any custom code or mappings that referenced the old `msfed_` namespace.
  - If you consume the managed solution file, the download name has been updated to begin with `MS-Gov`.

This release prepares the Financials starter kit for broader government reuse and collaboration by moving away from a federal-specific namespace and naming.
