## Inspectable Items and Item Types

You can set up inspectable items and item types. Examples of inspectable items could be buildings, vehicles, equipment, or any other object or scenario that requires review.

## Checklists (Using Interactive Prompts)

Each Inspection can use one or more Checklists (Interactive Prompts) and track the responses (Interactive Responses).

Each checklist item can have a parent item, short name, prompt text, and details.

Checklists can have sub-items to allow you to create hierarchical checklists with questions of various types.
