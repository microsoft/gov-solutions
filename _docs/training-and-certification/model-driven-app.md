# Overview

This template includes a model-driven app with Enrollment and Attendance (Persons, Training Course Enrollees, Training Class Enrollees, Training Class Attendees, Training Achievements) and Setup (Training Objectives, Training Instructors, Training Courses, Training Certificates, Training Classes).

Note - there is an alternative model-driven app available, Federal Academy, which is more specifically tailored to academic institutions offering courses to prospective students.
