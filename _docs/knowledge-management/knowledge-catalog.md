# Overview

The Knowledge Catalog is a Canvas App that allows organizations to provide a simple yet attractive "card catalog" knowledge base to collect information about various topics, and then to associate those topics to one another in a flexible manner.

The Knowledge Catalog is based on the same overall data model and functionality of the One Federal - Showcase app. Now you can bring this app to your own customers!

For example, you could use this app to stand up an "App Store", by curating all of the app templates available across the organization.
