The Executive Coordination app is part of the Microsoft Federal Application Starter Templates, an open-source library specifically designed to help you accelerate your mission modernization, using Microsoft's low code platform, Power Apps.

This app allows organizations to track, analyze, plan for, and monitor implementation of agency level formal actions. For example, agencies can use it to track executive orders and other legal authorities and mandates issued by governing bodies, as well as analyses, risks, impacts, implementation plans, and individual and team action items for those items.

# App Navigation

Within the app, you'll see a number of areas available within the main navigation. Clicking into these areas will allow you to view dashboards, use AI, manage records, and more. Let's review these areas together in more detail.

# Legal Authorities

In the Legal Authorities area you will find a list of all of the various Executive Orders, Congressional Mandates, Policy Directives, and other Legal Authority Types.

Within this view you can sort, filter, group, and personalize which columns appear, as well as other functions.

Navigating into an item will take you to the full details for that item. Here in the Legal Authority, we see the Name, Types, Summary, Disposition Notes, as well as official document numbers and public URLs.

Use the Amendments tab to track officially published changes to the mandates, allowing you to track change history over time.

Use the Cross-References tab to track how this order impacts, or is impacted by, other legal authorities.

## Analyses, Risks, and Impacts

Use the Analysis tab to create department specific analyses, assigned to specific teams or individuals to complete.

Or, simply use the Impacts and Risks areas to directly track impact and risk items in a more freeform manner. These can later be grouped together into one or more Analyses for reporting purposes.

## Related Executive Actions

And finally, when you are ready to begin planning and implementation, use the Executive Actions area to initiate a new Executive Action record for milestone tracking and individual and team assignments. More on this area later.

# Generative AI: Legal Authority Analyzer

Summarizing and analyzing the impacts of executive orders and other legal mandates can be a daunting task. The app comes with a large language model powered Legal Authority Analyzer which helps you with these activities.

Simply copy and paste the text of an executive order or other legal mandate into the text area and select Analyze. The app will provide a high level summary of the order.

Use the Impacts and Risks tab to narrow down on department-specific impacts and risks, which can then be used to help construct your implementation plan.

# Executive Actions (Implementation Plans)

Once the previous steps have been completed, you are now ready to begin the Executive Action implementation and monitoring cycle.

Navigate to the Executive Actions area to view a list of previous and existing implementation plans.

Select an item to begin viewing more details. Note the Summary, Classification, Receipt, and Source Authority sections. These help you to identify and get an overall picture of the implementation plan.

As with all the Federal App Starter Templates, you are free to add, change, or move fields on the various forms.

## Action Items (Business Process Template) Sidebar

Also note the Action Items side pane on the right. Here in this area you can select a process template to run, or use the plus button to begin creating a new, ad-hoc set of action items within your implementation plan.

Selecting a specific action item will take you to more details about that item. Here, use the various tabs to update the description, add group discussion notes, assign users, set due dates, and more. Use the progress buttons at the bottom to move the action item back and forth in the process.

When you are ready, close out of the Action Item to return to the full implementation plan.

Once back in the full plan, you can navigate to other Action Items, create new ad-hoc items, or navigate back to the main starting point to run multiple processes against the same Executive Action. This provides you ultimate flexibility in deciding how to assign and track tasks within the organization.

By default, the Executive Coordination app template opens the action items pane as a sidebar. This sidebar can be resized as needed to give you a side-by-side view of the action item along with the full list.

The option also exists to open the pane as a dialog, which can help keep sole focus on the action items that need to be completed.

# Summary

The Executive Coordination starter template allows you to import, create, and manage formal agency actions such as correspondence, policy directives, executive orders, and other legal mandates; to summarize and analyze them for impacts and risks; and to create and manage executive action implementation plans with team and individual action item assignments for monitoring and completion.

Together, these features give you a solid start towards establishing a repeatable, auditable framework for tracking agency taskers and translating high-level mandates into coordinated, accountable actions across your organization.
