Multiple visualizations of the events are possible by using Power BI visualizations.

#  Modifying the report

To make changes to the Power BI reports, you can open them in Power BI (web version). From there you can make changes or if you prefer, use the web version to open the Power BI Report using Power BI desktop. Save / republish your changes. The solution will automatically keep the changes in sync. Synchronize your changes back down to source control if needed.
