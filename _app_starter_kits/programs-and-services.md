The **Programs and Services** app is an early-stage concept designed to give agencies a standardized framework for managing benefits, entitlements, and service delivery. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides the building blocks for enrolling participants, defining services, tracking entitlements, and recording claims, helping agencies deliver programs in a more transparent and accountable way.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with starter forms for entities such as **Program, Program Service, Program Service Activity, Program Enrollee, Program Entitlement, Program Enrollee Entitlement, and Program Claim**. This structure establishes the relationships between a program, the services it offers, the people or organizations enrolled, and the entitlements and claims associated with participation.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to support a broad range of agency missions. A healthcare program could use it to manage enrollee records, assign entitlements for coverage, and track claims for visits or prescriptions. A workforce training initiative could record enrollee participation, issue tuition or stipend entitlements, and track activities such as classes attended or certifications achieved. Community service or outreach programs could log service delivery activities, monitor usage, and assess outcomes over time.

Potential future features include dashboards for monitoring program participation and claim trends, workflows for processing enrollee requests and eligibility determinations, and integrations with external financial or case management systems. The module could also be extended to support compliance reporting, giving agencies the ability to trace entitlements and claims back to funding sources and program requirements.

Because this app is still in an early stage of development, current functionality is limited to basic navigation and forms. However, the underlying data model provides a reusable foundation that agencies can adapt to many types of benefit and service programs, ensuring consistency, transparency, and accountability in how public services are delivered.
