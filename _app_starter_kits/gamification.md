The **Gamification** app is an early-stage concept designed to help agencies apply motivational techniques—such as points, progress tracking, and recognition—to internal programs, external outreach, and collaborative initiatives. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the module provides a flexible structure for recognizing achievement and driving engagement while remaining lightweight and adaptable to different mission contexts.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with a simple sitemap and starter forms for key entities. These include **Games, Game Activities, Game Achievements, Game Users, Game User Activities, and Game User Achievements**, which together form the foundation for defining programs, capturing participation, and awarding recognition. At this stage, the app provides only a skeleton interface, but the data model establishes the building blocks for future functionality.

Potential use cases span a wide range of agency scenarios. Internally, HR and training offices could use the app to encourage employees to complete learning programs or participate in wellness activities. Program offices could recognize collaboration and innovation by awarding achievements for contributions to projects or cross-agency initiatives. Public-facing programs could engage communities by creating games around civic participation, environmental stewardship, or volunteering, with achievements marking meaningful milestones like “Neighborhood Leader” or “Community Champion.” Even executive secretary offices could adapt gamification to track and reward timely responses to correspondence or taskers.

By standardizing how games, activities, and achievements are structured, the Gamification module allows agencies to bring recognition and motivation into mission delivery in a way that is transparent, flexible, and reusable across scenarios. The current shell app provides the groundwork, while future iterations can expand to create a rich engagement toolkit that agencies can tailor to their needs.
