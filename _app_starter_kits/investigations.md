The **Investigations** app is an early-stage concept designed to help agencies manage investigative casework in a structured, auditable way. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides a standardized framework for tracking leads, referrals, evidence, and violations within a unified case record. The goal is to give agencies a flexible but disciplined foundation for investigative case management that can scale across compliance oversight, law enforcement, or internal review missions.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with a sitemap and starter forms for entities such as **ICM Case, ICM Lead, ICM Referral, ICM Case Contact, ICM Case Contact Violation, ICM Evidence, ICM Case Evidence, ICM Violation, and ICM Case Violation**. Together, these tables provide the backbone for recording how a case was initiated, documenting the people involved, maintaining a clear chain-of-custody for evidence, and linking specific violations to individuals and statutory authorities.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to support the full lifecycle of investigative work. Agencies could use it to log referrals from partner organizations, capture tips as leads, and elevate them into formal cases. Investigators could build case records that link to witnesses, complainants, and subjects, attach evidence and notes, and document violations tied to laws or policies. Oversight and compliance offices might use the same framework to track case origin, analyze violation patterns, and report outcomes across programs. Potential future features include dashboards highlighting open cases and trends, workflow automation for approval and escalation steps, and integration with document or evidence management systems.

Because this app is still in an early stage of development, its current functionality is limited to shell navigation and basic forms. However, the underlying data model lays the groundwork for a comprehensive investigative case management solution that agencies can expand and adapt to their unique enforcement or oversight responsibilities.
