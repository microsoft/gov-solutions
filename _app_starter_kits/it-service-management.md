The **IT Service Management** app is an early-stage concept designed to help agencies manage the full spectrum of IT operations, from service desk requests to system accreditation and compliance. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides a unified structure for tracking services, systems, entitlements, and oversight activities, giving agencies a foundation to modernize technology operations while maintaining accountability and security.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with a sitemap and starter forms for entities such as **IT Service Requests, IT System Access Requests, IT Assigned Entitlements, IT Products, IT Systems, IT System Components, IT Datacenters, IT System Accreditation, Compliance Requirements, IT Compliance Assessments, and IT POAM Items**. These entities establish the building blocks for capturing requests, managing system details, and documenting compliance obligations.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to support agencies in multiple ways. Service desks could use it to capture and resolve user requests, track entitlements, and manage provisioning workflows. System owners could use it to record system components, hosting details, and accreditation records tied to compliance requirements. Security teams could document findings from compliance assessments, create POAM items to address gaps, and monitor remediation through dashboards. By connecting service delivery, entitlement tracking, and compliance oversight in one structure, the app enables agencies to balance operational efficiency with security and governance.

Potential future features include dashboards showing request volumes, entitlement status, and accreditation timelines; automated workflows to enforce least-privilege access principles; and integrations with asset management or external compliance tools. The module could also extend to link IT service activities back to budget structures using **Work Assignment Codes**, providing greater transparency into how IT resources are used and funded.

Because this app is still in an early stage of development, current functionality is limited to shell navigation and basic forms. However, the underlying data model lays the groundwork for a robust IT service management solution that agencies can adapt and expand to support their mission needs.
