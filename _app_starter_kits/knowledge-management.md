The **Knowledge Management** app is an early-stage solution designed to help agencies capture, organize, and share institutional knowledge. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides a consistent framework for creating knowledge articles, structuring them into catalogs and categories, and ensuring that information remains accurate, searchable, and accessible across mission areas.

The current baseline includes a **model-driven app** with shell forms for core entities such as **KB Article, KM Catalog Item, KM Catalog Item Type, KM Catalog Item Relation, KM Catalog Item POC, and KM Category**. This structure allows agencies to store guidance and reference materials, organize them into catalog items, assign ownership through points of contact, and connect related resources. In addition, a **FAQ Canvas App** prototype provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and answering common questions, demonstrating how the module can support both staff and public-facing scenarios.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to serve as a central knowledge hub for diverse agency needs. IT programs could integrate KB Articles with service requests to support troubleshooting. HR teams might maintain catalogs of policies and procedures, linking items to responsible owners for accountability. Compliance offices could organize regulatory requirements, using catalog item relations to show dependencies, cross-references, or superseded rules. Future features may include AI-powered search, recommendation engines to surface related articles, and dashboards that track knowledge usage and gaps.

By linking articles, catalogs, categories, and points of contact, the Knowledge Management app reduces duplication, strengthens accountability, and improves discoverability of information. Though currently limited to shell navigation and prototypes, the underlying data model provides a foundation for building robust knowledge-sharing platforms that agencies can adapt and expand to meet evolving mission demands.
