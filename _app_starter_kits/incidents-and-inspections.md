The **Incidents and Inspections** app is an early-stage concept designed to help agencies track, analyze, and follow up on both unexpected events and planned oversight activities. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides a standardized framework for capturing what happened, what was found, and what corrective actions were recommendedâ€”helping agencies strengthen accountability and ensure that issues are resolved, not just recorded.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with a sitemap and starter forms for entities such as **Incident or Event, After Action Report, Inspection, Inspectable Item, Inspectable Item Type, Finding, and Recommendation**. Together, these tables form the backbone for linking incidents and inspections to their outcomes and ensuring follow-through on corrective measures.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to support a wide range of oversight scenarios. Safety offices could use it to log incidents, conduct reviews through After Action Reports, and track Findings such as equipment failures or process gaps. Regulatory units might schedule inspections of facilities or systems, classify inspectable items by type, and issue Recommendations for compliance improvements. Program oversight teams could use the same structure to perform performance inspections, identify deficiencies, and ensure that corrective actions are implemented across initiatives.

Potential future features may include dashboards that highlight open Findings and overdue Recommendations, automated workflows that notify responsible parties of assigned corrective actions, and integration with other modules such as **Asset Management** (for equipment inspections), **Workplace Disputes** (for incidents tied to personnel issues), or **Executive Coordination** (for incidents or inspections that result in high-level taskers).

Because the app is in an early stage of development, current functionality is limited to shell navigation and basic forms. However, the underlying data model provides a reusable framework for agencies to strengthen oversight, improve safety, and close the loop between identifying issues and making lasting improvements.
