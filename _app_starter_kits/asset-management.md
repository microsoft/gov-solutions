The **Asset Management** module provides a structured framework for tracking, managing, and maintaining physical and accountable assets across government organizations. Built on the Asset Management data model, it delivers a model-driven app with forms, views, and dashboards that streamline asset operations and strengthen accountability across the enterprise.

At the center of the module is the **Assets** area, which serves as the primary hub for managing the lifecycle of individual assets. From here, users can register new assets through quick create forms, link them to categories, owners, and locations, and maintain detailed records including service history. Asset forms make it easy to update status information—such as whether an item is in service, retired, or transferred—while preserving a clear audit trail of ownership and usage.

Supporting this are several reference areas that provide standardization and consistency across the system. **Asset Categories** allow agencies to define and manage types of assets, ensuring that classification remains uniform for reporting and compliance purposes. **Asset Owners** provide visibility into responsibility for each asset, whether assigned to individuals, teams, or external partners, with ownership changes tracked over time to maintain accountability. **Locations** capture where assets are housed or deployed, supporting logistics, field operations, and accurate inventory control.

Finally, the module includes **Service Records**, which provide a complete history of maintenance, inspections, and repairs for each asset. Users can log service events directly from the asset record, capturing dates, service types, and outcomes. This ensures that every asset carries its full maintenance record, supporting compliance with regulatory requirements and enabling agencies to plan preventive maintenance programs with confidence.

By bringing together assets, categories, ownership, locations, and service histories in a single system, the Asset Management module provides agencies with full visibility into the resources that support their mission while reducing duplication and improving lifecycle oversight.
