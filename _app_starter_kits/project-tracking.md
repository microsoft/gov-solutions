The **Project Tracking** app provides agencies with a structured way to request, plan, and manage projects from start to finish. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app delivers a standardized framework for tracking project requests, resources, milestones, and work items, giving teams a clear view of progress and accountability across initiatives.

The current release includes a **model-driven app** with dashboards and forms for managing project lifecycles. Agencies can capture **Project Requests** through either the model-driven app or a **starter Canvas App**, making it easy for staff to propose new projects. Once approved, projects can be detailed with information on objectives, scope, and resources. Users can assign team members, manage **Project Milestones and Iterations**, and track dependencies across the project timeline.

For delivery management, the app includes features to manage **Backlogs and Work Items**, offering a lightweight alternative for agencies without access to Azure DevOps. Teams can capture and prioritize tasks, log progress, and ensure work items are tied back to project goals. **Change Requests** can be logged and tracked, ensuring that scope adjustments are transparent and properly reviewed. Dashboards provide leadership with visibility into active projects, pending requests, and the status of ongoing work.

Looking ahead, the app is envisioned to grow into a more comprehensive project portfolio management solution. Future enhancements may include integration with time and expense tracking, alignment to budget and funding sources, and advanced reporting on performance metrics. By capturing requests, resources, milestones, and outcomes in one place, the Project Tracking app provides agencies with the tools they need to oversee projects consistently and effectively.
