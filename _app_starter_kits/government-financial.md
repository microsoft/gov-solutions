The **Government Financial** app is an early-stage concept that provides government agencies with a unified approach to budgeting, procurement, contracting, and oversight. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the module is designed to help agencies maintain transparency and accountability in the use of public funds, while offering flexibility to support day-to-day financial operations.

The current baseline includes a **model-driven app** with shell forms for key entities such as **Budgets, Budget Line Items, Budget Object Classifications, Purchase Requests, Purchase Request Items, Procurement Packages, Contracts, Products, Locations, States or Provinces, Audit Projects, and Audit Subjects**. Together, these form the foundation for tracking appropriations, procurement activities, vendor agreements, and oversight reviews. In addition, the module includes a **Canvas App prototype modeled after GSA Form 49**, giving users a familiar interface for entering and reviewing financial data.

Over time, this module is envisioned to support the full lifecycle of government financial management. Agencies could plan allocations at the **budget and line item** level, categorize expenditures using **object classifications**, and initiate **purchase requests** that flow through procurement and into formal **contracts**. **Procurement packages** would allow consolidation of requests and competitive bidding, while **audit projects** and **audit subjects** provide a built-in mechanism for oversight and compliance reviews.

Potential future features include integration with external procurement systems, dashboards for budget execution and contract performance, and automated workflows to align purchase requests with available funding. Agencies could apply the app to a wide range of scenariosâ€”from planning annual budgets and tracking contract awards, to monitoring financial risks and ensuring audit readiness.

Because this app is in its early stage of development, these features represent a vision of what may be included as the module evolves, with the current release providing the foundational structure to build upon.
