The **Workplace Dispute** app is an early-stage concept designed to help agencies manage the sensitive processes surrounding employee disputes, complaints, and resolutions. Built on Microsoft Power Platform, the app provides a structured framework for recording and tracking Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), and Harassment cases, giving agencies a starting point for handling these matters in a consistent, auditable way.

The current baseline consists of a **model-driven app** with shell entities for each dispute area. The **ADR** section includes **ADRs, ADR Persons, and ADR Sessions**, supporting early intervention and mediation. The **EEO** section includes **EEO Cases, Case Claims, Case Decisions, Case Investigations, Case Persons, and Inquiries**, providing a structure for managing formal complaints, investigations, and resolutions. The **Harassment** section mirrors this structure with **Harassment Cases, Claims, Decisions, Investigations, Persons, and Inquiries**, creating a clear record of cases from intake through outcome.

Looking ahead, the app could evolve into a more comprehensive workplace dispute management solution. Agencies might introduce **confidential intake portals** for employees to submit concerns, workflows to guide HR staff through statutory timelines and required steps, and dashboards to monitor dispute resolution metrics. Integration with related modules such as **HR Administration** could help tie dispute cases back to personnel records, while **Knowledge Management** could provide access to policy references, guidance, or training materials. Over time, analytics could help leadership identify trends across dispute types, monitor compliance with resolution timelines, and strengthen workplace culture by addressing root causes.

Because the app is still in an early stage of development, current functionality is limited to shell navigation and basic forms. However, the underlying structure lays the groundwork for a system that agencies can expand to meet legal, compliance, and cultural needs for dispute resolution in the federal workplace.
