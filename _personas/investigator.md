An Investigator carries out fact-finding activities across a range of government contexts â€” from personnel security background investigations to Office of Inspector General (OIG) inquiries and administrative misconduct reviews. Investigators gather, analyze, and document evidence, interview subjects and witnesses, and produce findings that inform adjudication, disciplinary, or audit actions.

## Major Responsibilities

* **Background Investigations:** Initiate and manage investigative cases, collect applicant and subject information, verify records, and compile investigative reports used for suitability and clearance decisions.
* **Inspections & Audits (OIG-style):** Plan and conduct inspections or audits, examine programs and transactions for compliance or fraud, and prepare findings for oversight bodies.
* **Evidence Collection & Chain of Custody:** Secure documents, electronic records, and physical evidence; maintain chain-of-custody and documentation standards to support legal and administrative processes.
* **Interviews & Witness Statements:** Conduct structured interviews, obtain sworn or recorded statements, and assess credibility and consistency of information.
* **Case Management & Tracking:** Use case-management systems to assign tasks, document progress, route cases to adjudicators or attorneys, and ensure timely resolution.
* **Collaboration with Legal & Security Teams:** Coordinate with legal counsel, HR, security officers, and prosecution partners to align investigative actions with policy and legal requirements.
* **Reporting & Recommendations:** Produce clear investigative reports, draft recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action, and present findings to decision-makers.

## Key Concerns

* Preserving evidence integrity and protecting chain-of-custody for admissibility.
* Ensuring investigations are fair, unbiased, and compliant with applicable laws and privacy protections.
* Protecting sensitive and classified information while enabling necessary information sharing.
* Managing workloads to meet statutory or policy-driven timelines for investigations and adjudications.
* Integrating disparate data sources (HR records, criminal histories, financial data, case notes) to form a complete case view.

## Typical Line of Business Applications (used during investigations)

* **Case Management / Investigative Platforms:** Track cases, assign tasks, record interviews, and manage attachments.
* **Records & Evidence Repositories:** Secure document stores, SharePoint, and evidence-management systems.
* **Background Check & Clearance Systems:** Tools for adjudication, clearance tracking, and continuous vetting alerts.
* **Analytics & Reporting (Power BI):** Dashboards for caseload, timelines, risk indicators, and inspection outcomes.
* **Identity & Vetting Data Sources:** Access to criminal records, credit history, civil enforcement databases, and personnel records.
* **Interview & Recording Tools:** Audio/video capture, transcription, and redaction utilities.
